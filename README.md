# Belly Button Biodiversity

Using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Plotly and D3 to analyze and present information about samples of bacteria 

## Overview of Project

Information about sample bacteria collected from many individuals. Results published on a GitHub Page include demographic information about individual and graphs presenting various data points.

### Purpose

Rosa is a biological researcher in a microbiology laboratory. Rosa is interested in bacteria that is able to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food start-up, to research candidate species. A microorganism that may supply the "next best taste" is bacteria found within the belly button. Samples are taken from the navels of individuals across the country. A website has been created to show the id and demographic information of the individual sampled, a bar and scatter plot of the most populous type of bacteria found in the navel, and a gauge chart that reflects how many times the navel is washed within a week period.
